# Campfire (Android)
*Explore a handpicked library of high quality song lyrics and chords.*

Campfire is a companion app for musicians and people who like to sing. It contains a small, but growing number of songs and song collections as well as useful features such as transposing the key signature, auto-scroll or the ability to create and share your own playlists.

The app follows the latest Material design guidelines, featuring beautiful animations and supporting both light and dark themes. 

Campfire is completely free, without any ads.

### Work in progress
The app is being rewritten from scratch.
The new version will use GitHub + [Google Sheets](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1fMJzjAYOqFi_DTiacPnf6XNWqhx5MqlGNIRRqJk_aCY/) as the source of data (since Heroku is no longer free). It will also feature updated UI and better architecture.
The old version can be found on the **master_legacy_v1** branch.
